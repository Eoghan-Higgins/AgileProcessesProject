Investigate Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into 
a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, test, 
and validate the full master branch, allowing teams to detect problems early. 

CI keeps the master branch clean. Teams can leverage modern version control systems such as 
Git to create short-lived feature branches to isolate their work. A developer submits a “pull request” 
when the feature is complete and, on approval of the pull request, the changes get merged into the master branch.

    Increase visibility enabling greater communication
    Catch issues early 
    Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
    Build a solid foundation
    Stop waiting to find out if your code’s going to work
    Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly
